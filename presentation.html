First of all, I would like to thank you for visiting my website, I hope you'll find it interesting. I start telling you something of my life related to design and to the passion that
                    I achieved over the years: in particoular I like to design, to develop and to understand the functionality of things in general since ever. After this preamble, I try to resume the road to "how I became a designer ". I have been a
                    curious kid and I really enjoyed my time drawing on every surface. I remember my father used to draw for me a football player kicking a penalty kick(and scoring as well) and I dreamt of being that guy(cause my favourite sport was football
                    at the time). I was enchanted to see him drawing, and I have been repeating to myself that I would become a creative in life. Growing up, my desire evolved into a passion and I started drawing everyday, making portraits, copying things
                    as environment, houses, streets, tools. During the high school this passion has been set aside for a while but it came back later stronger than ever. This was the reason why I signed up to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scuolacomics.com/sede/pescara">Comics International School</a>(illustration
                    & visual arts school) in Pescara.</h3>

                <h3 class="fw-light my-4">After the graduation I also took another important decision to concretize my education. I tryed to subscribe myself to a master in Milan(<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.mimasterillustrazione.com/it/staff-mimaster-direzione/">OPPI MiMaster</a>),
                    a master of illustration and graphic design. It's been a beautiful experience, where I learnt how best italian publishing houses and magazines use to work. So,this journey took me to become a professional illustrator but not a complete
                    designer yet; i thought I had to increase my preparation to work as a designer. So, I started to attend a graphic design course during lockdown. The school is named <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" HREF="https://www.jobformazione.com/">JOB FORMAZIONE</a>                    and helped me to understand graphic design and UI/UX design rules. After all of these experiences, I found my first job as a designer in a serigraphy. I still work there after more than 2 years. But it wasn't enough again(LOL). My
                    goal in life is to grow as human being in every aspect. I have heard about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://talent.start2impact.it/users/sign_in">Start2Impact</a>, a beautiful new reality in digital design and I started
                    a web developing course.</h3>
